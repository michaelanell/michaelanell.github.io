        <h2>Life in Herriman</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>"Herriman was established in 1851 by Henry Harriman, Thomas Jefferson Butterfield, John Jay Stocking, and
            Robert Cowan Petty.[8] A fort was established where the community garden is today. The only remnants of Fort
            Herriman are the two black locust trees that stand where the entrance to the fort once was. The Fort was
            abandoned in 1857 as the Johnston Army came West. Herriman remained a small community until 1999 when
            proactive citizens including Brett Wood and J. Lynn Crane went door to door asking people to sign a petition
            to be incorporated into a town. In 1998 Rose Creek Estates, developed by Watt Homes, started the first
            "subdivision" with property under 1 acre. Later, Rosecrest, a land developer who acquired some rights in a
            large area around Herriman, and started large scale residential development.[9] Rosecrest is owned by parent
            company Sorenson Companies[10] founded by the late James LeVoy Sorenson and currently managed by his
            son.[citation needed] In 2007, Rosecrest won a lawsuit with partner land owners/developers that allowed
            about 4,000 acres (16 km2) to be annexed out of neighboring city Bluffdale into Herriman to further expand
            the Rosecrest/Herriman housing projects.[11] The lawsuit stemmed from a struggle between Bluffdale city
            officials, strict city building requirements, and Rosecrest.[11] The addition of Rosecrest greatly brought
            up Herriman's population and enabled the town to be turned into a city." Derived from Wikipedia.</p>
