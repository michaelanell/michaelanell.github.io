                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <img class="city-img" src="images/thecove.jpeg" alt="Pond at the Cove">
                <p>"Herriman was established in 1851 by Henry Harriman, Thomas Jefferson Butterfield, John Jay Stocking,
                    and
                    Robert Cowan Petty.[8] A fort was established where the community garden is today. The only remnants
                    of
                    Fort
                    Herriman are the two black locust trees that stand where the entrance to the fort once was. The Fort
                    was
                    abandoned in 1857 as the Johnston Army came West. Herriman remained a small community until 1999
                    when
                    proactive citizens including Brett Wood and J. Lynn Crane went door to door asking people to sign a
                    petition
                    to be incorporated into a town. In 1998 Rose Creek Estates, developed by Watt Homes, started the
                    first
                    "subdivision" with property under 1 acre. Later, Rosecrest, a land developer who acquired some
                    rights in
                    a
                    large area around Herriman, and started large scale residential development.[9] Rosecrest is owned
                    by
                    parent
                    company Sorenson Companies[10] founded by the late James LeVoy Sorenson and currently managed by his
                    son.[citation needed] In 2007, Rosecrest won a lawsuit with partner land owners/developers that
                    allowed
                    about 4,000 acres (16 km2) to be annexed out of neighboring city Bluffdale into Herriman to further
                    expand
                    the Rosecrest/Herriman housing projects.[11] The lawsuit stemmed from a struggle between Bluffdale
                    city
                    officials, strict city building requirements, and Rosecrest.[11] The addition of Rosecrest greatly
                    brought
                    up Herriman's population and enabled the town to be turned into a city." Derived from Wikipedia.</p>
