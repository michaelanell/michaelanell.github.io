                    county was
                    organized in 1919. In the 1860s, Soda Springs served as the seat of Oneida County. The city
                    is named
                    for
                    the hundreds of natural springs of carbonated water that are located in and around the
                    city.[6] The
                    springs were well known to Native Americans and were a famous landmark along the Oregon
                    Trail in the
                    middle 19th century. Today the city is also known as the location of the Soda Springs
                    Geyser, which
                    was
                    unleashed in 1934 when "town fathers" were looking for hot water for a "hot pool" bathing
